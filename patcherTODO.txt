Todo:

- Consider: When patching, don't take the server sided score but the maximum
  between the local and the server one.
- To deal with when level submission was off, we could patch level scores
  by looking up the episode runs and extracting the level times form there.
  Update: This is not possible since the episode runs contain the demos,
  but not the scores of each individual level, and we can't deduce
  how much gold was collected.
- Translate the scores into a integer number of frames, so that when the total
  scores are calculated, we get actual multiples of 0.017.
